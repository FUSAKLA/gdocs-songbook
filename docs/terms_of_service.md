# Foreword

Hi, first I’d like to state that this add-on is non-profitable, and I made it public just in the sense of a good will,
so it can help others who want to manage their own songbooks. Having said that, I can honestly tell you I’m not
interested in any personal data of yours, and I do not wish to cause any harm by using the add-on. Hopefully you find it
helpful!

The source code of the add-on is open sourced on GitHub and can be
found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/FUSAKLA/gdocs-songbook), so please, feel free to inspect it on your own.

# Terms of Service

The Google Docs add-on named Songbook (later referred just as an add-on)
does manage files in the Google Drive of the user. This is done just to persist songbooks or import songs. It operates
only inside the main configured folder by the user. The User uses this plugin on his own risk and in case of accidental
malformation or deletion of any data the author of the add-on is not responsible for causing any damages to the user,
but Google Drive automatically puts everything to the trash bin and has a history of changes, so any accidental damage
should be possible to undo.

# Privacy Policy

The plugin does not use any user data whatsoever. Not even cookies, nor any ads. Nothing. All the documents stays on
your Google Drive and nothing is sent anywhere. I do not care about sites you visit and really have no interest in
spamming you with emails :)


---

So hopefully you are OK with all of that and in that case I wish you happy playing/singing!

In the opposite case I’m sorry that the terms does not fit your needs.
